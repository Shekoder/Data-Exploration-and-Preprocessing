# Exploring Data: A Deep Dive into Restaurant Trends üçΩüìä

## Overview

Welcome to my project where I delve into restaurant data to uncover hidden patterns and trends. This project covers data exploration, preprocessing, descriptive analysis, and geospatial insights to understand restaurant ratings, cuisines, and locations.

## Project Highlights

### Data Exploration & Preprocessing

- **Objective**: Uncover hidden patterns by exploring the dataset, managing missing values, and transforming data types.
- **Tasks**:
  - Analyzed the distribution of "Aggregate Ratings" to identify any imbalances.
  - Handled missing values and converted columns to appropriate data types for further analysis.

### Descriptive Analysis

- **Objective**: Perform statistical analysis and explore various aspects of the dataset.
- **Tasks**:
  - Calculated basic statistical measures (mean, median, standard deviation) for numerical columns.
  - Examined the distribution of categorical variables such as "Country Code," "City," and "Cuisines."
  - Identified top cuisines and cities with the highest number of restaurants.

### Geospatial Insights

- **Objective**: Visualize restaurant locations and analyze the correlation between ratings and locations.
- **Tasks**:
  - Mapped restaurant locations to visualize their spread globally üåç.
  - Investigated correlations between restaurant ratings and their locations, revealing intriguing patterns and trends.
